# RW-VanillaChemfuelRedux
Reworks the Vanilla Rimworld Chemfuel, giving new ways to generate and use the material. Also provides earlier access to Chemfuel, and a later stage which should mean it maintains use later in the game.

My attempt to rebalance the Vanilla Chemfuel experience, adding new generators, recipes for chemfuel and requirements. You should progress through chemical study to add new chemfuel-related content.

This also contains Recipes from my ChemfuelfromX mod, which is available as a standalone mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2902146860).

There are also a few new ways to make Vanilla items via chemfuel.
